# An Introduction to GPU Ray Tracing with OptiX #

![](images/readme_header2.png)

## What is this? ##

This is *An Introduction to GPU Ray Tracing with Optix*.\
An Introductory text to learning the Nvidia OptiX Ray tracing SDK.

Within the body of the SDK there are a large number of holistic programs that encapsulate an entire
ray tracing project. However, at time of writing, there does not exist an adequate introduction
publically.

This text is an attempt to remedy that. All projects will be built incremently, one subsection at a
time. There should never be more than 1 thing to be learn at a time.

## Expected Experience ##

I expect the minimum from you:
- Some experience in c++

As tools and ideas are introduced, their understanding will be explained. If there is an idea or
implementation detail that is not fully explained, that is a **bug** and should be fixed.

## Tools Used by OIOW ##

The following tools will be used:
- A C++ compiler (Clang, GCC, VS, ...)
- NVCC (For Cuda Compilation)
- Nvidia OptiX SDK
- CMake (for builds)

## Acknowledgements ##

- Peter Shirley
- Ingo Wald
- João Vítor Silva
- Steve Hollasch
- Morgan McGuire

## Contributing ##

If you find a problem with the project, whether that is in the source or in the text, I politely
request that you create an issue. Rather than a pull request.
